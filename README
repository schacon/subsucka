SubSucka
======================

SubSucka sucks a SVN repository into Git in a distributed manner. 

Since jQuery has about 4000 commits, this will split up into 40 threads that each 
fetch 1/40th of the repo, then pull all the objects into one repo and rewrite all
of the commit objects properly with data obtained from 'svn log'.

When it works (ie: when SVN doesn't hang), it goes WAY faster than git-svn import.


Getting Started
======================

 rake c                      # will compile and start the shell
 > subsucka_server:start().  # starts the master node
 > subsucka_slave:start().   # starts the slave node
 > subversion_import:import_uri('http://test.com').

Benchmarks (Ruby Prototype)

$> time ruby subsucka.rb 
real	8m53.966s

$>time git svn clone http://tarski.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ t3
