SubSucka
======================

SubSucka sucks a SVN repository into Git in a (eventually) distributed manner. 
Currently, it simply threads, so it can do multiple SVN updates in parallel.

The idea is that you run something like this:

s = SubSucka.new('http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build', 40)
s.result_url

Since jQuery has about 4000 commits, this will split up into 40 threads that each 
fetch 1/40th of the repo, then pull all the objects into one repo and rewrite all
of the commit objects properly with data obtained from 'svn log'.

When it works (ie: when SVN doesn't hang), it goes WAY faster than git-svn import.
