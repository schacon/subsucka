 Server 
================

== Workflow ==

* gets a request with a svn repo url
* contacts the repo and queries max revision number
* sees how many clients are live and federates the revisions
* sends each client it's job (url, start_rev, end_rev)
* polls clients occasionally
** if one goes down, restarts it
* when client 1 is done (1-X revisions), clones the repo locally
* when clients 2-N are done, (in order), fetches the repo and rebases the commits
* updates project status table

== Methods ==

* ID = new_request(url, git_repo_name)
* status = request_status(ID)
* clear_request(ID)
* push_status(ID, status)


 Client
================

* connects to server, registers itself
* gets a url and revision range from server
* imports the svn to git
* returns clone url
* removes job from queue

== Methods ==

* ID = start_request(url, start_rev, end_rev)
* status = request_status(ID)
* url = get_clone_url(ID)
* load = client_status
